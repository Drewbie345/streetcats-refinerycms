    <h2>About Our Adoption Fee</h2>
    <em><h4>Our adoption fee is $75. For two kitties, the adoption fee is $135. We also offer a $65 adoption fee for a Senior Discount. A Senior Discount for 2 cats is $120.</h4></em>

    <p>Each cat that is admitted into StreetCats has a comprehensive physical exam by a veterinarian. If any problems are found, they are treated before the kitty is put on our adoption list.</p>

    <p>In addition, the cats are tested for Feline Leukemia Virus and FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus). Cats are also tested for worms, and if found, are dewormed. A flea treatment is applied and vaccinations (rabies and FVRCP) are given. If not already done, the cat is also spayed/neutered.</p>

    <p>All of the services are valued at $300. This does not include any additional treatment if a medical problem is found. We rely on our donations to help cover the medical costs on our kitties.</p>
